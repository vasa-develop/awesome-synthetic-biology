Graph edges are labeled with sets of IDs for genetic parts such as promoters, coding sequences, and terminators. Each path from a start node to a stop node represents a combinatorial set of designs formed by concatenating one part from each edge in the path.
- [Merlin](https://www.cidarlab.org/merlin): Merlin is a web-based application for genomic reprogramming via a rapid and efficient method known as Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE).

With Neptune, researchers and microfluidic designers have all the tools needed to design, fabricate, and control microfluidic devices. Neptune supports high level specification of the layout and function of a microfluidic chip.
- [Owl](https://www.cidarlab.org/owl): Owl is a tool that allows users to create electronic datasheets for new biological parts, devices, or systems. Users can enter their data into preexisting fields for a given data model and add their own data from assays. Or users can search from existing webpages on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts (parts.igem.org) and produce datasheets in a consistent format.
- [Oriole](https://www.cidarlab.org/oriole): Oriole is a synthetic biology design tool that divides a biological network into implementable sub-networks, when given a set of engineering constraints. It allows users to convert a biological network, such as a gene regulatory network, metabolic network or species interaction network, into its graphical representation, and be divided into a set of sub-networks with user-defined objectives and constraints. Such sub-networks can be engineered experimentally to communicate and carry out distributed functions.
- [Phagebook](https://www.cidarlab.org/phagebook): Phagebook is a Clotho 3.0 app that serves as a social networking interface incorporating lab inventory management and project/personnel networking.
